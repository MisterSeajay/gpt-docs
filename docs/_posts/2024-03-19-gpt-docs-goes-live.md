The documentation pages for [joynt.co.uk GPTs](https://gpt.joynt.co.uk) are now
live. The site is using the [**Minimal Mistakes**](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)
theme.

This is a slightly more involved theme than the **minima** one used in the
[dev.joynt.co.uk](https://dev.joynt.co.uk) site, but the benefit is a much more
attractive and engaging layout.

Features used in this site include:

* Images, especially on the ["splash page"](https://gpt.joynt.co.uk/)
* Permalinks for pages, esp. for GPT pages,
e.g. [/arcane_paintbrush/](https://gpt.joynt.co.uk/arcane_paintbrush)
* New [category](./category/) and [tag](./tag/) pages for posts.
